    Cascading Style Sheets (abbreviated as CSS): It is a formatting language for web pages that is concerned with the form and design of websites. It was specifically designed to separate formatting (colors - fonts - buttons...) from the content of the written document (for example, in HTML). This applies to colors, fonts, images, and backgrounds. Which are used on pages, with complete flexibility and ease.

This technology is concerned with the overall appearance of website pages, including colors, images, etc. It can be added to the page in several ways, the best of which is external embed by writing the CSS code in a separate file. It has been developed to currently reach CSS 3, to which several additions were added that were not available in the previous version and were accomplished only with jQuery.

<h3>Features of CSS technology</h3>

<h2 id="j1">JavaScript</h2>

<p>

    JavaScript, commonly known as "JS" (in English: JavaScript), is a high-level programming language, mainly used in web browsers to create more interactive pages. It is currently being developed by the TC39 committee managed by the EACMA standards organization.

    JavaScript began to be used as a programming language aimed at amateur and non-professional programmers. However, interest in it increased and it attracted the attention of professional programmers after adding new technologies, such as the spread of AJAX technology, which led to faster interaction between the server and the client.
    
    JavaScript is used to develop interactive web pages and web applications, including games. It is used by most websites, and is supported by almost all browsers without the need for external add-ons.

</p>

<h3>The foundation of the JavaScript language consists of common features of programming languages, which allow us to:</h3>

<ul>

    <li>storing values ​​inside variables,</li>
    <li>Perform manipulations on text strings,</li>
    <li>Performing certain actions depending on the occurrence of events.</li>
</ul>

HTML is the structure of a web page and gives the Internet browser a description of how to display its contents. It can be helped by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages ​​​​such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from the web server or from the file system and display them. The function of the HTML language is to describe the structure of pages. Web structurally.

Elements in HTML are the basic building block for building HTML documents, through which we can add images and interactive objects such as forms or video and audio files. You can also create organized documents by using tags to declare paragraphs, headings, links, quotations, tables, etc.
 
HTML can include programs written in languages ​​such as JavaScript to modify the behavior and content of web pages. Adding CSS codes leads to defining the form and layout of the content.

<h3>HTML pages are composed of elements</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Start tag</li>
   <li>End tag</li>
